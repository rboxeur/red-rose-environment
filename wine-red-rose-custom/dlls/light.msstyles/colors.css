/* The general approach is to use the same color names as in .rc files. If you change a color
 * here, you probably want to make a similar change in light.rc.
 *
 * Imagemagick doesn't support CSS variables, so we have to put the color values into the classes
 * directly.  The SVG files specify fill and stroke colors, and in some cases both. An SVG element
 * can only have one class though. So as long as only one color is needed, we use
 *
 * <rect ... class="HighlightOutline" fill="currentColor" />
 * <path ... class="HighlightOutline" stroke="currentColor" />
 *
 * If one SVG element needs two different colors we have to define a separate class:
 *
 * .WindowBackgroundHighlightOutline
 * {
 *     fill:#ffffff; /* match WindowBackground.color * /
 *     stroke:#2979ff; /* match HighlightOutline.color * /
 * }
 *
 * And then use it like
 *
 * <rect ... class="WindowBackgroundHighlightOutline" />
 */
