# red-rose-environment

This repository provides my Wine build to play native Windows games on Linux.

It is based on  

- a Wine version taken from [Glorious Eggroll proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) version 9-22.
- a patch was applied to remove any Steam dependancy on this Wine version.

To keep it up-to-date then a few patches are applied from repositories listed below

- https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests
- https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/tree/bleeding-edge
- https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom

Wine is built using a customized/enhanced environment based on the one provided by default by [Kron4ek](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds)
